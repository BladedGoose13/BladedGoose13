I am an Engineering Physics student at Tecnol√≥gico de Monterrey. My interests include electronics, quantum technologies, and data-driven problem-solving. I also have interdisciplinary interests in management, economics, and human sciences.

Currently self-learning PCB design on Altium and electronic simulation on LTSPICE, I complement my studies with international academic experience through a summer exchange at Sungkyunkwan University (South Korea), where I studied thermodynamics and statistical analysis in Python; as well as part of my high school in Seville, Spain.

I hold a Cambridge C1 English certification and am currently preparing for the JLPT-N5 in Japanese language.

My goal is to apply my skills in physics, electronics, and computation to cutting-edge industrial R&D projects in areas such as photonics & quantum technologies, semiconductors and advanced electronics
